    <sec id="section-who-we-are"><span>WHO WE ARE</span><br><br>
    Big Medium is a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting artists 
    and building community through the arts in Austin and across Texas.
    We provide opportunities for artists to create, exhibit, and discuss their
    work and connect to an engaged and diverse audience. <br> <br>
    We strive to make art a part of everyday life.
